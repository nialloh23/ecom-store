# About: 
Joeblob.co is a flexible e-commerce store built with django and react/redux.
I built the application as a forcing function to learn/explore the django and react technologies.
The project is not currently used for selling any products but if someone wants to use it for doing so fire ahead :)
The application code closely follows the tutorials in a Udemy course called 
[Django with React | An Ecommerce Website](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-with-react-an-ecommerce-website/) by @divanov11
